Amazon DynamoDB

   Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value database service. It delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.
   
   
   
   1. DynamoDB is serverless, which means that you do not have to provision, patch, or manage servers. You also do not have to install, maintain, or operate software.
   2. As the size of your database shrinks or grows, DynamoDB automatically scales to adjust for changes in capacity while maintaining consistent performance. 
       This makes it a suitable choice for use cases that require high performance while scaling.
