Nonrelational databases
  1. In a nonrelational database, you create tables. A table is a place where you can store and query data.
  2. Nonrelational databases are sometimes referred to as “NoSQL databases” because they use structures other than rows and columns to organize data.
  3. One type of structural approach for nonrelational databases is key-value pairs. With key-value pairs, data is organized into items (keys), and items have attributes (values).
  4. In a key-value database, you can add or remove attributes from items in the table at any time.
