Nonrelational databases
  1. In a nonrelational database, you create tables. A table is a place where you can store and query data.
  2. Nonrelational databases are sometimes referred to as “NoSQL databases” because they use structures other than rows and columns to organize data.
  3. One type of structural approach for nonrelational databases is key-value pairs. With key-value pairs, data is organized into items (keys), and items have attributes (values).
  4. In a key-value database, you can add or remove attributes from items in the table at any time.
  
  
  Amazon DynamoDB

   Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value database service. It delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.
   
   
   
   1. DynamoDB is serverless, which means that you do not have to provision, patch, or manage servers. You also do not have to install, maintain, or operate software.
   2. As the size of your database shrinks or grows, DynamoDB automatically scales to adjust for changes in capacity while maintaining consistent performance. 
       This makes it a suitable choice for use cases that require high performance while scaling.
