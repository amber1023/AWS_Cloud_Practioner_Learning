When determining the right Region for your services, data, and applications,
consider the following four business factors. 

1.Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
2. Proximity to your customers
3. Available Services within a Region
4. Pricing


Availability Zone
An Availability Zone is a single data center or a group of data centers within a Region.
Availability Zones are located tens of miles apart from each other. 
This is close enough to have low latency (the time between when content requested and received)
between Availability Zones. However, if a disaster occurs in one part of the
Region, they are distant enough to reduce the chance that multiple Availability Zones are affected.
