1. AWS Console
   The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services.
   You can quickly access recently used services and search

2.AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
  To save time when making API requests, you can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). 
  AWS CLI enables you to control multiple AWS services directly from the command line
  within one tool. AWS CLI is available for users on Windows, macOS, and Linux. 
  By using AWS CLI, you can automate the actions that your services and applications perform 
  through scripts. For example, you can use commands to launch an Amazon EC2 instance, 
  connect an Amazon EC2 instance to a specific Auto Scaling group, and more.
  
3. software development kits (SDKs)
   DKs make it easier for you to use AWS services through an API designed for your programming
   language or platform. SDKs enable you to use AWS services with
   your existing applications or create entirely new applications that will run on AWS.


AWS Elastic BeanStalk
With AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you provide code and configuration settings, and Elastic 
Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform the following tasks:

Adjust capacity
Load balancing
Automatic scaling
Application health monitoring

AWS CloudFormation

With AWS CloudFormation, you can treat your infrastructure as code. 
This means that you can build an environment by writing
lines of code instead of using the AWS Management Console to individually provision resources.
AWS CloudFormation provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner, enabling you to frequently
build your infrastructure and applications without having to perform manual actions. It determines the
right operations to perform when managing your stack and rolls back changes automatically if it detects errors.
