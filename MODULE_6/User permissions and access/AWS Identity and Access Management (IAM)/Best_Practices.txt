Do not use the root user for everyday tasks. 
Instead, use the root user to create your first IAM user and assign it permissions to create other users.
Then, continue to create other IAM users, and access those identities for performing regular tasks throughout AWS.
Only use the root user when you need to perform a limited number of tasks that are only available to the root user.



create individual IAM users for each person who needs to access AWS.  
Even if you have multiple employees who require the same level of access, you should create individual IAM users
for each of them. 
This provides additional security by allowing each IAM user to have a unique set of security credentials.



Follow the security principle of least privilege when granting permissions. 
By following this principle, you help to prevent users or roles from having more permissions than needed to
perform their tasks. 
For example, if an employee needs access to only a specific bucket, specify the bucket in the IAM policy. 
Do this instead of granting the employee access to all of the buckets in your AWS account.




IAM roles are ideal for situations in which access to services or resources needs to be granted temporarily, instead of long-term.
