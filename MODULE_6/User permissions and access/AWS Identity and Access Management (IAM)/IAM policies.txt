IAM policies
An IAM policy is a document that allows or denies permissions to AWS services and resources.  
IAM policies enable you to customize users’ levels of access to resources. For example,
you can allow users to access all of the Amazon S3 buckets within your AWS account, 
or only a specific bucket.






Here’s an example of how IAM policies work. Suppose that the coffee shop owner has to create an IAM user for a newly hired cashier. The cashier needs access to the receipts kept in an Amazon S3 bucket with the ID: AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET.

In this example, the IAM policy is allowing a specific action within Amazon S3: ListObject. The policy also mentions a specific bucket ID: AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET. When the owner attaches this policy to the cashier’s IAM user, it will allow the cashier to view all of the objects in the AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET bucket. 

If the owner wants the cashier to be able to access other services and perform other actions in AWS, the owner must attach additional policies to specify these services and actions.


Now, suppose that the coffee shop has hired a few more cashiers. Instead of assigning permissions to each individual IAM user, the owner places the users into an IAM group.
