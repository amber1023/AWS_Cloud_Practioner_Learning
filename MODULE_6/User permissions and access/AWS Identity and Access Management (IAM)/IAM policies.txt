IAM policies
An IAM policy is a document that allows or denies permissions to AWS services and resources.  
IAM policies enable you to customize usersâ€™ levels of access to resources. For example,
you can allow users to access all of the Amazon S3 buckets within your AWS account, 
or only a specific bucket.
