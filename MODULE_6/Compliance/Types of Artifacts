AWS Artifact consists of two main sections:
   1.  AWS Artifact Agreements
    Suppose that your company needs to sign an agreement with AWS regarding your use of certain types of 
    information throughout AWS services. You can do this through AWS Artifact Agreements. 
    
    you can review, accept, and manage agreements for an individual account and for all your accounts in AWS Organizations.
    Different types of agreements are offered to address the needs of customers who are subject to specific regulations,
      such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
    
    
   2.  AWS Artifact Reports
       
       Next, suppose that a member of your companyâ€™s development team is building an application and needs more information about their responsibility for complying with certain regulatory standards. 
       You can advise them to access this information in AWS Artifact Reports.
       AWS Artifact Reports provide compliance reports from third-party auditors. 
       These auditors have tested and verified that AWS is compliant with a variety of global, regional, and industry-specific security standards and regulations.
       AWS Artifact Reports remains up to date with the latest reports released.
       You can provide the AWS audit artifacts to your auditors or regulators as evidence of AWS security controls.
