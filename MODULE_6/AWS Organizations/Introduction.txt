AWS Organizations
 Suppose that your company has multiple AWS accounts. You can use AWS Organizations to consolidate and manage multiple AWS accounts within a central location.
 
 When you create an organization, AWS Organizations automatically creates a root, which is the parent container for all the accounts in your organization. 
 In AWS Organizations, you can centrally control permissions for the accounts in your organization by using service control policies (SCPs).
 SCPs enable you to place restrictions on the AWS services, resources, and individual API actions that users and roles in each account can access.
