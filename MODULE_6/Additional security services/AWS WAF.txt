Suppose that your application has been receiving malicious network requests from several IP addresses.
You want to prevent these requests from continuing to access your application, but you also want to ensure that legitimate users can still access it.
You configure the web ACL to allow all requests except those from the IP addresses that you have specified.


AWS WAF:
is a web application firewall that lets you monitor network requests that come into your web applications. 
AWS WAF works together with Amazon CloudFront and an Application Load Balancer. 
AWS WAF works in a similar way to block or allow traffic. 
by using a web access control list (ACL) to protect your AWS resources. 
When a request comes into AWS WAF, it checks against the list of rules that you have configured in the web ACL. 
If a request did not come from one of the blocked IP addresses, it allows access to the application.

However, if a request came from one of the blocked IP addresses that you have specified in the web ACL, it is denied access.
