   <h3>treat the environment as a collection of parts that build upon each other.  </h3>
 <h3>AWS is responsible for some parts of your environment and you (the customer) are responsible for other parts. This concept is known as the shared responsibility model. </h3>
 
 <h3>The shared responsibility model divides into customer responsibilities (commonly referred to as “security in the cloud”).  and AWS responsibilities (commonly referred to as “security of the cloud”).</h3>
 
 
 
 <p>You can think of this model as being similar to the division of responsibilities between a homeowner and a homebuilder. The builder (AWS) is responsible for constructing your house and ensuring that it is solidly built. 
 As the homeowner (the customer), it is your responsibility to secure everything in the house by ensuring that the doors are closed and locked.</p>
