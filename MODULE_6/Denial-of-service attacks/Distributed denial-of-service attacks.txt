The prankster and their friends repeatedly call the coffee shop with requests to place orders, even though they do not intend to pick them up. 
These requests are coming in from different phone numbers, and it’s impossible for the coffee shop to block them all. 
Additionally, the influx of calls has made it increasingly difficult for customers to be able to get their calls through. 
This is similar to a distributed denial-of-service attack.

In a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, multiple sources are used to start an attack that aims to make a website or application unavailable. 
This can come from a group of attackers, or even a single attacker. 

The single attacker can use multiple infected computers (also known as “bots”) to send excessive traffic to a website or application.

To help minimize the effect of DoS and DDoS attacks on your applications, you can use AWS Shield.
