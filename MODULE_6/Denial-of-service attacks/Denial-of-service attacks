A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a deliberate attempt to make a website or application unavailable to users.

For example, an attacker might flood a website or application with excessive network traffic until the targeted website or application becomes overloaded and is no longer able to respond. If the website or application becomes unavailable, this denies service to users who are trying to make legitimate requests.
