1. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
   A networking service that you can use to establish boundaries around your
   AWS resources is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
   
   . In this isolated section, you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define.
   Within a virtual private cloud (VPC), you can organize your resources into subnets.
   A subnet is a section of a VPC that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 instances.
   
 2. Internet gateway
    To allow public traffic from the internet to access your VPC, 
    you attach an internet gateway to the VPC.
    
    An internet gateway is a connection between a VPC and the internet. You can think of an internet gateway as being similar to a doorway that customers use to enter the coffee shop. Without an internet gateway, no one can access the resources within your VPC.
    
    
    Virtual Private Gateway
    
    To access private resources in a VPC, you can use a virtual private gateway. 
    The bodyguard is like a virtual private network (VPN) connection that encrypts (or protects) 
    your internet traffic from all the other requests around it. 

The virtual private gateway is the component that allows protected internet traffic to enter into the VPC.

A virtual private gateway enables you to establish a virtual private network (VPN) connection 
between your VPC and a private network, such as an on-premises data center or internal corporate 
network. 
A virtual private gateway allows traffic into the VPC only if it is coming from an approved network.



3.AWS Direct Connect
   AWS Direct Connect is a service that enables you to establish a dedicated private connection
   between your data center and a VPC.  The private connection that AWS Direct Connect provides helps 
   you to reduce network costs 
   and increase the amount of bandwidth that can travel through your network.
